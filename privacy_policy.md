SummNews Privacy Policy
-----------------------------

Effective date: June 21, 2023

Muhammad Abu-Alhamd operates the SummNews mobile application (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").

This page informs you of my policies regarding the use of the app and the choices you have associated with that use.

### Data Collection and Use

The app is a news application that you can use to summerize articles. The app does not collect any personal or non-personal data. It does not require you to sign up or create an account.

### Security

As the app does not collect or store any personal or non-personal data, there is no user information to secure. However, I take reasonable measures to protect the security of the app itself and ensure that it operates as intended. Please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure and I cannot guarantee the absolute security of the app.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
